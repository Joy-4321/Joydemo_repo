<div>Created a new file and making changes to a newfile.
    if I do  git status, it will show me that there is a file that is yet to be tracked 
    <div class="
    I can use the name of the file to be specific to add the file to the folder to be tracked or I can use .(period) and it will track all
    changes made, then i proceed to commit. Let's go there.
    you can see beside the created file , you see the U, meaning the file is untracked."></div>
