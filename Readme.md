md means mark down. the readme file is a mark down file. let's save this.

Hit the commit button to save it.


you can use the pen Icon to make changes directly or you hit the name of the file, which will appear as a link and it will open the file where 
you are working on or you worked on.
also notice that when you wanted to commit , you saw a default place holder with a text, create a Readme.md.  you can always change the text to what suits you. then commit the change.
let me do a ne commit. this will update what so ever i have on this file previously.
